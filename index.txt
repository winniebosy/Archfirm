Accessibility Issues encountered when tackling this project



The use of Buttons and links
Rule: Actions where users affect the website’s back-end or front-end use Buttons.
      Actions where users won’t affect the website at all use links.

ARIA-LABELS ON LINKS:
Use an aria-label attribute in the link code that provides specific information to the screen reader user.
eXAMPLE: <p><a href=”taxhike.html” aria-label=”Read more about Marlborough tax hike”>Read more…</a></p>

First of all, what’s a CTA?

CTA stands for call-to-action and refers to the prompt for users to take an action. It can be a button, a hyperlink, or even an image but the text generally denotes the action you want a user to take.

            <img src="Images/envelope-regular.svg" alt="Email us">
        </a>


this can be used to change the color of an svg as desired.put directly in the svg code
fill="var(--svgcolor)"



Grid areas offer developers with ease in coming up with responsive sites.


Screen readers and other assistive technology, just as web browsers, hide elements from their users when they are styled using display: none; and visibility: hidden;.

The common approach used to hide information visually but keep them available to screen reader and other assistive technology users is to use CSS that will keep the information technically visible but practically hidden. For example, presenting the label in a 1-by-1 pixel area, as demonstrated with the CSS class visuallyhidden (do not confuse with CSS visibility: hidden) below:
Code Snippet

.visuallyhidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
}

Note that interactive elements are still active when using this code, so it is not suitable to hide other parts of forms but the labels.
